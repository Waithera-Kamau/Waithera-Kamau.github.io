Welcome to my digital home.

I'm Cynthia Kamau — a cybersecurity analyst, data enthusiast, and passionate advocate for digital protection in humanitarian contexts. With experience at the World Food Programme and a strong foundation in IT support, I've worked on securing systems, solving vulnerabilities with Qualys, and enhancing internal visibility through data-driven insights.

I use this space to share my journey in cybersecurity, reflections on personal growth, and research on the intersection of technology and humanitarian work.

### What You'll Find Here:
- Weekly cybersecurity articles — every Wednesday.
- Research insights and tools for securing humanitarian organizations.
- Reflections on healing, boundaries, and building emotional intelligence.
- Resources for personal and professional growth.

Whether you're in tech, working in development, or on your own journey of self-discovery — I hope you find something here that resonates.

> Protection goes beyond data. Let's build safer systems — and stronger selves.
