#The Story Behind the Data
Every spreadsheet tells a story. Every vulnerability patched protects someone's livelihood. Every dashboard I build bridges the gap between raw information and life-changing decisions.

**I'm Cynthia Kamau, and I turn data into hope.**

#From Numbers to Impact
At the World Food Programme, I don't just analyze data—I trace the digital threads that connect donors to hungry families, logistics to life-saving supplies, and security protocols to the protection of the world's most vulnerable populations.

*My work starts with Python scripts and Tableau visualizations, but it ends with real people receiving the help they need.*

#The Unlikely Path
Banking taught me precision. IT support taught me patience. But humanitarian work? That taught me purpose.
From processing transactions at Equity Bank to mapping geospatial assets from space, my journey has been anything but linear. Each role revealed a new piece of who *I'm becoming—someone who sees the human story hidden in every dataset.*

#What Keeps Me Curious
The intersection of technology and humanity. How can we make data more accessible? How do we secure systems without creating barriers? How do we ensure that our digital tools serve those who need them most?
*These questions drive everything I do, from the vulnerability assessments I conduct to the peace-building reports I write.*
